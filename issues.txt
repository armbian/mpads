Issues:

Serial Mux:
- BI input for 7seg needs to be inverted
- Pins for I2C addr selection use smaller pitch? Why?
- Resistors for 7seg a bit large? Very dim leds, depends on the 7seg though

SD Mux:
- Add a reset jumper or btn for the STM32
- Missing pull up on USB-DP (need 1.5kOhm pullup to 3.3V)  https://www.st.com/resource/en/application_note/dm00296349-usb-hardware-and-pcb-guidelines-using-stm32-mcus-stmicroelectronics.pdf
- only 1bit SDIO mode working (need to investigate)
